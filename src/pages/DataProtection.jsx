              <p>
                We have concluded a contract with Google for the outsourcing of
                data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of
                the German data protection authorities when using Google
                Analytics. Demographic data collection by Google Analytics This
                website uses the demographic functions of Google Analytics. This
                allows reports to be generated that contain statements about the
                age, gender and interests of site visitors. This data comes from
                Google's interest-based advertising and third-party visitor
                data. This collected data cannot be assigned to a specific
                person. You can deactivate this function at any time via the ad
                settings in your Google account or prohibit the collection of
                your data by Google Analytics, as described in the section
                "Objection to data collection".

              <p>
                If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the
                website, we require a valid email address from you as well as
                information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of
                the email address provided and that you agree to receive the
                newsletter. Further data is not collected or only on a voluntary
                basis. We use this data only for sending the requested
                information and do not pass it on to third parties.We therefore
                only process the data you enter in the contact form for the
                newsletter with your consent. You can revoke your consent to the
                storage of the data, the email address and their use for sending
                the newsletter at any time, e.g. via the "unsubscribe" link in
                the newsletter. The data processed until receipt of your request
                may continue to be processed lawfully.The data provided when
                registering for the newsletter will be used for sending the
                newsletter until you unsubscribe from the newsletter, after
                which this data will be deleted. Data that we have stored for
                other purposes (e.g. e-mail addresses for the members' area)
                remain unaffected by this.MailChimpThis website uses the
                services of MailChimp to send newsletters. This service is
                provided by Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE,
                Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.MailChimp is a service that
                organizes and evaluates the sending of newsletters. When you
                provide data (e.g. your email address) to subscribe to our
                newsletter, this data is stored on MailChimp servers in the
                USA.We use MailChimp to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When
                you open an email sent by MailChimp, a file contained in the
                email (a so-called web beacon) connects to MailChimp's servers
                in the USA. This allows us to determine whether a newsletter
                message has been opened and which links you click on. In
                addition, technical information is collected (e.g. time of
                retrieval, IP address, browser type and operating system). This
                information cannot be assigned to a specific recipient. It is
                used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter
                campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better
                tailor future newsletters to your interests.If you do not want
                your use of the newsletter to be analyzed by MailChimp, you must
                unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a
                link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from
                the newsletter directly on the website.The data processing is
                based on your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time
                by unsubscribing from the newsletter. The data processed until
                your revocation may continue to be processed lawfully.The data
                provided when registering for the newsletter will be used for
                sending the newsletter until you unsubscribe, after which this
                data will be deleted from our servers and those of MailChimp.
                Data that we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email
                addresses for the member area) remain unaffected.Details can be
