                Prior to reading the general risk warnings, we would like to
                point out that inexperienced investors are always advised to
                consult a trusted financial expert. Never put “all eggs in one
                basket” and study our client's offering and the risk profiles of
                the investments in detail. You should never invest more than 5%
                of your net worth into individual products with a high-risk
                profile. FINMA, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory
                Authority, offers support and inputs about how to properly
                evaluate offerings from individual and non-regulated providers.
                You can always reach out to us if you feel insecure or have any
                questions. We are always happy to help!

                not guarantee a minimum rate of return or liquidity. The
                invested capital is at risk and complete loss of the invested
                capital may incur. The terms and conditions are exclusively
                according to the official sale prospectus, available at our
                client's websites. Before deciding on an investment, read the
                risk warnings carefully, or in case of doubt, consult a trusted
                financial expert. Please note, historical or projected
                performance information is not a reliable indicator for future
                earnings or losses.
